Dependency inversion principle states that we must use abstraction (interface and abstract classes) instead of
concrete implementation.
1. High level module should not depend on low level module but both should depend on the abstraction.
2. It emphasizes the importance of decoupling high level module and low level module by introducing 
   an abstract layer between them.
