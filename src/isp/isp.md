Interface segregation principle states that larger interfaces should be divided into smaller interfaces because
implementation classes use only the methods that are required.
1. We should not force the client to use the methods that they do not want to use.
2. The goal of this principle is similar to Single Responsibility principle
3. ISP ensures that interfaces are designed in a way that is specific and relevant to the needs of the clients
    that use them.
